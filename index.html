                                        <p> Hi! I'm currently a second-year student at UC Berkeley, studying Computer Science and Economics. I'm also pursuing studies in Music and Theater. In the past, I've worked on the <a href="https://gosu-lang.github.io/">Gosu Development Team</a> at <a href="https://www.guidewire.com/">Guidewire Software</a>. You can check out other things that I've worked on below; alternatively, my resume can be viewed <a href="assets/resume.pdf">here.</a> </p>

                                <h4> Summer 2017 </h4>
                                    <p> I was lucky enough to be a summer intern at <a href="https://www.guidewire.com/">Guidewire Software</a>, in Foster City, CA. Guidewire creates a wide variety of software products for Property and Casualty (P&mp;C) Insurers, and is one of the market leaders in the field. </p>
                                    <p> Within Guidewire, I worked as a part of the <a href="https://gosu-lang.github.io/">Gosu Team</a>, who was/is responsible for creating and maintaining Gosu, a programming language for the JVM that many of Guidewire's applications are built on. Some of my highlights of the summer were:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li> Co-creating Barebones, a templating language/engine for the JVM (based off of JSP, if you're familiar).</li>
                                        <li> Co-creating WhatVersionOfGosuAmIUsing, a web-based file browser/searcher that allows Guidewire engineers to more easily traverse through application release files in order to make the task of identifying the Gosu version that particular Guidewire product/release uses.</li>
                                        <li> Free Food! </li>
                                    </ul> 
                                <h3> Agentmotions </h3>
                                <h4> Summer 2016 - Summer 2017 </h4>
                                    <p> In the summer immediately after high school (and throughout my first year of college), I worked at Agentmotions, a marketing startup based in Pleasanton, CA. Specifically, Agentmotions provides outsourced marketing services for real estate agents (and other small businesses) - this includes website creation, email marketing, snail mail, and CRM, among other things. </p>
                                    <p> I was responsible for "technical operations," which primarily meant the maintenance and creation of websites for clients. Throughout my time at Agentmotions, I worked on over 15 different websites, which includes the creation of ~10 of those websites from scratch. Additionally, I worked with Mailchimp and Klayvio to send monthly email newsletters for serveral clients.  I also worked with other CRM tools, such as Infusionsoft and TopProducer. </p>

                                <p> Note: I am working on creating more detailed write-ups/reflections for my projects; for now, links will lead to the Github repo for the particular project. </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Single-Person DBMS</strong> (Fall 2017): Includes implementations of B+ tree, Table Iterators, Nested Loops Join, External Sort, Sort-Merge Join, Query Optimizer. Done in class (CS 186). </li>
                                    <li><strong>LunchMeet</strong> (Summer 2017): Web application that maintains a userbase and matches users with each other for lunch based on availabilities, shared interests, food restrictions, etc. Built at LinkedIn Hackathon. </li>
                                    <li><strong>Barebones</strong> (Summer 2017): A templating engine for the JVM that's removed from the servlet infrastructure. Additionally, it supports typed arguments to templates in order to take advantage of Java's static type-checking. We built a lexer and a program that turns Barebones files into valid Java files. Built at Guidewire. </li>
                                    <li><strong>WhatVersionOfGosuAmIUsing</strong> (Summer 2017): An internal tool for Guidewire - essentially, it's a web-based file browser/searcher that helps Guidewire engineers identify the version of Gosu that a particular release of a particular product is using. The issue that the tool helps alleviate is the nesting of .jar and .zip files within each other - there's no easy way to easily unpack .jar files within .jar files without unpacking the entire outer file, and traversing large and complicated build files using a terminal is often difficult and tedious. We provide a natural way to traverse/search through these files. Notably, we used Barebones as the front-end "view" of the web application (pretty cool, if you ask me!). Built at Guidewire.  </li>
                                </ul>
